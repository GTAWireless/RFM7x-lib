## Test results

### bk2423

Setting RX_SEN seems to not affect detection levels as advertised in AN0007, in both datarate ranges.
The lowest measured power levels are close to the receiver sensitivity (around -84dBm) in the table with "RS_SEN=0". 

- highpower and other weird modes; still not tested

### bk2425

- still not tested, probably no selectable rssi level
